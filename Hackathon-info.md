# BioMatch: DNA-Compatible Organ Donor Finder

## Inspiration

Every **10 minutes**, someone dies waiting for an organ transplant. With over **100,000 Peoples** on waiting lists currently (OPTN), I realized that the bottleneck isn't just organ availability, it's **intelligent matching**. Current systems rely on basic blood type compatibility, but **HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) genetic matching** can reduce rejection rates by up to **40%**.

For me, this problem is deeply personal my **dad is still waiting for a kidney transplant** due to CKD. Seeing firsthand how long and uncertain this process is motivated me to build BioMatch. I wanted to create something that could improve the odds for people like him, and the thousands of families facing the same struggle.

## What it does

BioMatch is a **DNA-based organ donor matching system** that revolutionizes transplant compatibility:

* **Multi-Organ Support**: Matches kidney, liver, heart, lung, and pancreas with organ-specific algorithms
* **Real HLA Data**: Uses authentic population genetics data from **8 genetic loci** (A, B, C, DPA1, DPB1, DQA1, DQB1, DRB1)
* **AI Predictive Analytics**: Groq-powered insights predict transplant success rates and rejection risks
* **Professional Interface**: Medical-grade UI with dark mode, responsive design, and PDF/JSON export
* **Real-time Processing**: 3 second analysis with live donor database updates

**Key Innovation**: It doesn’t just find match, it also **predicts outcomes** using AI analysis of genetic compatibility patterns.

## How I built it

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and responsive design
- **AI Integration**: Groq API for clinical insights and predictive analytics
- **Data Source**: Real HLA allele frequency data from population genetics
databases [Allele Frequency](https://www.allelefrequencies.net)
- **Matching Algorithm**: Custom compatibility scoring with cross-reactive groups and partial matches
- **Architecture**: Client-side processing with TSV data parsing and weighted random selection

**Technical Highlights**:

* Integrated **authentic HLA data** from 8 TSV files containing real population genetics over 38,000 rows/tsv of data
* Built **organ-specific matching algorithms** with different compatibility thresholds
* Created **AI-powered clinical decision support** with structured JSON responses
* Implemented **PDF export** with comprehensive medical reports

## Challenges we ran into

1. **Data Integration Complexity**: Parsing real HLA frequency data from multiple TSV files and handling different population distributions
2. **Medical Accuracy**: Ensuring my matching algorithms reflect actual transplant medicine practices
3. **AI Response Parsing**: Converting Groq's natural language responses into structured medical insights
4. **Performance Optimization**: Loading large genetic datasets without blocking the UI
5. **React Object Rendering**: Debugging complex object structures being passed as React children

**Biggest Challenge**: Making the system medically credible while keeping it accessible for demonstration.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

* **Real Medical Data**: Successfully integrated authentic HLA allele frequencies from population genetics databases
* **AI Superiority**: Built predictive analytics that go beyond basic matching to forecast transplant outcomes
* **Professional Quality**: Created a medical-grade interface that hospitals could actually use
* **Technical Innovation**: Developed organ-specific algorithms with weighted compatibility scoring
* **Complete System**: From HLA input to AI insights to PDF export a full end-to-end solution

**Most Proud**: I built something that could genuinely **save lives** including my dad’s, if deployed in real medical settings.

## What I learned

* **Population Genetics**: Deep dive into HLA allele distributions across different ethnic groups
* **Transplant Medicine**: Understanding the complexity of organ compatibility beyond blood types
* **AI Integration**: How to structure prompts for consistent, parseable medical insights
* **Medical UI/UX**: Designing interfaces that convey trust and professionalism for healthcare
* **Data Processing**: Efficiently handling large genetic datasets in client-side applications

**Key Insight**: The gap between current organ matching systems and what's technically possible with AI and genetics is **enormous**.

## What's next for BioMatch

### Immediate Enhancements

* **Blockchain Integration**: Immutable matching records for audit trails
* **Mobile App**: Emergency matching for on-call transplant coordinators
* **API Development**: Integration with hospital EMR systems
* **Global Network**: International organ sharing protocols

### Long-term Vision

* **FDA Approval**: Clinical trials to validate AI predictions against real transplant outcomes
* **Hospital Partnerships**: Pilot programs with major transplant centers
* **Machine Learning**: Train models on historical transplant data for even better predictions
* **Real-time Network**: Live donor database with instant matching notifications

**Ultimate Goal**: Replace current organ matching systems with AI-powered precision medicine that **doubles transplant success rates** and saves thousands of lives annually.
